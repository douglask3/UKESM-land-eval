\begin{abstract}
\textbf{ Background/knowledge gap:} 
Effective targetted development of the land surface component, JULES-ES, within the UK Earth System Model relies on identifying the source of biases in model performance. 

\textbf{Aim:} 
Here, we investigate the propagation of land surface biases in UKESM and attribute the sources of these biases' to JULES-ES or climate model performance and missing land surface processes. 

\textbf{Methods}: 
We perform a comprehensive global assessment of land surface climate inputs, broadscale vegetation distribution, productivity, carbon storage and turnover, and water fluxes.  Assessment is made against observations wherever possible, focusing on UKESMs historic ensemble performance from 2001-2014. We assess biases in climate space to attribute between climate inputs and land surface performance. We also use drought metrics linked to land surface temperature to link carbon, hydrological and climate input biases.

\textbf{Key results:} Broadscale vegetation distribution biases include too much tree cover in grassy biomes, with corresponding high total vegetation carbon and <<turnover time>>.  These regions coincide with areas of burning, not represented in the model, and highly seasonal moisture availability in shorter, srubby vegetation. The Sahel, western India and Northern Australia are expectations, with too little vegetation cover and too-rapid a transition between productive and arid areas. In these regions, precipitation and temperature biases lead to drier conditions and less productivity than JULES-ES driven by observations.

Based on this, we identify developments to the land surface scheme that may improve UKESM in subsequent releases. The introduction of fire or improved representation of vegetation responses to dry conditions. (permafrost). (Methane) (Inundation)

\introduction  %% \introduction[modified heading if necessary]

The UK Earth System Model (UKESM1,\cite{Sellar2019-bo}) includes an interactive land-surface scheme through coupling to the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES; \cite{best2011joint,clark2011joint}). Feedback between land and atmosphere includes surface energy balance, a dynamic snowpack, vertical heat and water fluxes, soil freezing, large-scale hydrology, carbon and nitrogen fluxes, and storage in both vegetation and soil. To provide these feedbacks, JULES represents terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycles \citep{wiltshire2020jules}, including dynamic vegetation and representation of agricultural land-use change \citep{robertson2019local}. It includes additional development to plant physiology and functional types \citep{harper2016improved, harper2018vegetation}. UKESM1 couples JULES to the HadGEM3-GC3.1 climate model (GC3.1 - \cite{kuhlbrodt2018low, williams2018met}) and unified troposphere-stratosphere chemistry and multi-species modal aerosol scheme (UKCA; ref). GC3.1 is also coupled to ocean biogeochemistry (BGC; ref.). 


<<A bit of UKESM history, including previous evaluations Led to land being included UK Earth System Models.>> However, the land surface's performance depends on both land surface and climate biases from the rest of the model, which adds complexity in identifying the source of any mismatch between simulation and observation. However, determining the causes of these biases is vital so that model development is targets overall model performance and realism, rather than simply obtaining better metric scores.

Here, we identify biases in several key land diagnostics in UKESM and attribute those biases to the simulation of the land by JULES-ES or climate biases from the rest of UKESM. We start by introducing the variables and corresponding observations and benchmarking methods we use for JULES-ES evaluation before outlining broad-scale benchmarking results. We then <<link these together>>. We then finish by identifying x development priorities <<list>> based on these and describe how each should be introduced to help improve the source of simulation error.

\section{Model overview}
The configuration of JULES used in UKESM1, namely JULES-ES, is an extension of the GL7 configuration \citep{wiltshire2020gl7}. JULES-ES represents the surface energy balance, a dynamic snowpack, vertical heat and water fluxes, soil freezing, large scale hydrology, carbon and nitrogen fluxes and storage in both vegetation and soil. JULES uses different discrete "tile" types to represent surface cover. Prescribed tiles are water bodies (lakes, rivers etc.), urban and land-ice. The rest of the land surface is competed over by 13 plant functional types (PFTs), divided by plant type (trees, shrubs and grasses), climate ranges (tropical and temperate/boreal), leaf type (broad or needle leaf) and leaf annual cycle (phenological response: evergreen or deciduous), and grasses by the type of photosynthesis they use (C3, C4). Each grass is further split between natural and imposed land use from crop or pasture, whereby a prescribed crop or pasture fraction only allow C3, C4 or bare soil (ref:Roberston). The Top-down Representation of Interactive Foliage and Flora Including Dynamics (TRIFFID) dynamic vegetation model (Wiltshire et al. 2020a) simulates dynamic vegetation,  carbon and nitrogen cycling in the soil and the RothC soil carbon model (Clarke et al. 2011). TRIFFID updates the PFT distribution in each grid cell through a height based competition scheme (ref)

\subsection{Vegetation and Soil Carbon}

Terrestrial processes in UKESM1 are represented by the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES; ). JULES represents the surface energy balance, a dynamic snowpack, vertical heat and water fluxes, soil freezing, large scale hydrology, and carbon and nitrogen fluxes and storage in both vegetation and soil. Dynamic vegetation and carbon and nitrogen cycling in the soil are provided by the Top-down Representation of Interactive Foliage and Flora Including Dynamics (TRIFFID) dynamic vegetation model \cite{wiltshire2020jules} and the RothC soil carbon model \cite{clark2011joint}. TRIFFID updates the PFT distribution in each grid cell through a height based competition scheme \citep{harper2016improved}. The configuration of JULES used in UKESM1 namely JULES-ES is an extension of the GL7 configuration \citep{wiltshire2020gl7} and described below in Section \ref{sec:gl7}). JULES-ES additionally includes TRIFFID, a simple landuse model and dynamic wetlands \color{red} more and references? \color{black}. 
 


\subsection{JULES-ES}

Summarised below is a description of the key differences between the GL7 configuration and the JULES-ES configuration used in UKESM1. In JULES-ES vegetation can be one of 13 plant functional types (PFTs), divided by plant type (trees, shrubs and grasses), climate ranges (tropical and temperate/boreal), leaf type (broad or needleleaf) and leaf annual cycle (phenological response: evergreen or deciduous), and grasses by the type of photosynthesis they use (C3, C4) with 4 of the PFTs reserved for an imposed land use.  \\

\subsubsection{Vegetation and Soil Carbon}
JULES simulates production on a sub-hourly timestep by scaling from stomatal-level conductance up to leaf level photosynthesis – which is dependent on available CO2 - and then canopy level gross primary production (GPP). Correspondingly, carbon is respired through plant growth and maintenance to give NPP. NPP is accumulated and passed to the TRIFFID dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) every 10 days. TRIFFID in turn updates the allocation to leaf, stem and root and the area covered by each PFT based on available carbon, nitrogen and competition between PFTS \citep{wiltshire2020jules}. Leaf phenology is updated daily for deciduous PFTs. Litter loss from biomass is input into the soil carbon-nitrogen model. Soil carbon decomposes at a rate driven by soil moisture, temperature and available nutrients. 



accumulated temperature-dependant leaf turnover rates. Live biomass loss from vegetation is input into a soil carbon pool, from which the ecosystems temperature and moisture dependent heterotrophic respiration and wetland methane are simulated.

\subsubsection{Carbon and nitrogen cycle}
The carbon cycling within JULES is a well established model that was used in both HadGEM2-ES \citep{collins2011development} and the Global Carbon Budget annual assessment up to 2018 \citep{le2018global}. For UKESM1 a significant upgrade to the terrestrial carbon cycle was made \citep{Sellar2019-bo} to include an interactive nitrogen cycle \citep{wiltshire2020jules}, extended PFTs \cite{harper2016improved} and land-use change. This configuration has been in use as part of the Global Carbon Budget assessment since 2019 \citep{essd-11-1783-2019}. In TRIFFID, the nitrogen cycle closely follows the structure of the carbon cycle. Inputs to TRIFFID are via biological fixation and nitrogen deposition, while losses occur via leaching and gas loss. JULES simulates a nitrogen-limited ecosystem by reducing the net primary productivity if there is insufficient inorganic nitrogen in the soil to maintain the C:N ratio of the vegetation with any excess carbon assumed to be lost from the system.\\

\subsubsection{Wetlands}
The scheme combines a mean water table depth with the sub-grid distribution of topography \citep{Gedney2019}, producing a distribution of water table depths within the grid box. The inundation fraction is therefore calculated from the proportion of water table depths which are above the surface. The wetland fraction is a subset of this, by excluding water tables which are sufficiently high for stream flow to occur.

\section{Evaluation methods}

We use the International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) \citep{Collier2018-ai} and fireMIP \citep{Kelley2013-ey, rabin2017fire}. benchamrking tools to evaluate model performance across multiple variables compared to observations. ILAMB was designed to provide a quantitative assessment of model fidelity across a wide range of terrestrial biogeochemical processes and interactions with hydrology and climate, within several key categories: the ecosystem and carbon cycle, hydrological cycle, radiation and energy, and forcings. The tool uses remote sensing, reanalysis data and fluxnet site measurements to benchmark performance and produce statistical scores of model results. 


\subsection{Cover distributions}
Compared using the Manhattan Metric ($MM$) and Square Chord Distance ($SCD$) \citep{Kelley2013-ey}.

\begin{equation}
    MM = \frac{\Sigma_i A_i \times \Sigma_j  |p_{i,j} - q_{i,j} |}{\Sigma_i A_i} \  \text{   and   } \
    SCD = \frac{\Sigma_i A_i \times \Sigma_j (p_{i,j} - q_{i,j} )^2}{\Sigma_i A_i}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Turnover times}
We follow the common definition of ecosystem carbon turnover time as the ration between the total carbon stocks and the outflux. For a terrestrial ecosystem, the total carbon stock is comprised of vegetation carbon and soil carbon, and the outflux is the carbon loss from the ecosystem, such as autotrophic respiration from plants and heterotrophic respiration from the soil. We can make a steady state assumption, which implies that the outflux of carbon into the ecosystem is equal to the influx.  Therefore, ecosystem carbon turnover time can be considered using the following equation $\tau_\mathrm{e}$ = (cSoil + cVeg)/GPP. Where, $\tau_\mathrm{e}$ is ecosystem carbon turnover time, cSoil is soil carbon, cVeg is vegetation carbon, and GPP is gross primary production.

We define soil carbon turnover as the ratio between the total carbon stocks and the outflux. For terrestrial soils, the total carbon stock is the total soil carbon stores and the outflux is heterotrophic respiration. Therefore, soil carbon turnover time can be considered using the following equation $\tau_\mathrm{s}$ = cSoil/$R_\mathrm{h}$. Where, $\tau_\mathrm{s}$ is soil carbon turnover, cSoil is soil carbon, and $R_\mathrm{h}$ is heterotrophic respiration.

The analysis was completed using model output from the historical simulation of the UKESM1-0-LL r1i1p1f2 variant. A reference time period was considered, 2001-2010, to best match the observational data time frame considered, then monthly model output data was time averaged over this period. The following output variables were considered in this analysis: ‘soil carbon content’ (cSoil) in $\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m}^{−2}$, ‘vegetation carbon content’ (cVeg) in $\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m}^{−2}$, ‘gross primary production’ (GPP) in $\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m}^{−2} \mathrm{s}^{−1}$,  ‘heterotrophic respiration carbon flux’ (Rh) in $\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m}^{−2} \mathrm{s}^{−1}$, ‘precipitation flux’ (Pr) in $\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m}^{−2} \mathrm{s}^{−1}$, and ‘air temperature’ (tas) in K.
The variables cSoil, cVeg, and GPP were used to obtain values for ecosystem carbon turnover time ($\tau_\mathrm{e}$) in years, using the equation $\tau_\mathrm{e}$ = (cSoil + cVeg)/(GPP ∗ 86400 ∗ 365). The variables cSoil and $R_\mathrm{h}$ were used to obtain values for soil carbon turnover time ($\tau_\mathrm{s}$) in years, using the equation $\tau_\mathrm{s}$ = cSoil/($R_\mathrm{h}$ ∗ 86400 ∗ 365). The model precipitation units were converted from $\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m}^{−2} \mathrm{s}^{−1}$ to $\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m}^{−2} \mathrm{yr}^{−1}$ for consistency. The model temperature variable units were converted from K to $^\circ$C. 

\subsection{Annual average comparisons}
The sum the squared (for $NMSE$) or absolute (for $NME$) distance between observations ($obs$) and reconstructed burnt area from an ensemble member (sim()) over all cells  ( ) weighted by cell area ( ) and normalised by mean variation in obs

\begin{equation}
    NME = \frac{\Sigma_i A_i \times  |sim - obs_i |}{\Sigma_i A_i \times |\bar{obs} - obs_i |} \  \text{   and   } \
    NMSE = \frac{\Sigma_i A_i \times  (sim- obs_i) }{\Sigma_i A_i \times (\bar{obs} - obs_i )}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Seasonal}
Seasonality comparisons are conducted in three parts as  (Kelley et al., submitted, 2013a): 1)modality - i.e how many “seasons” there are in a given year; 2), phase, or timing, of the season; and 3) seasonal concentration (inverse season length).

To determine the modality of a given cell, we first calculated the monthly climatology. The month of the minimum burnt area from this climatology is defined as the start of the “fire year”. We then find the position of each maxima turning point throughout the year:	
\begin{equation}
    P = \left\{p_i | \frac{dv(p_i)}{dt} = 0 \wedge \frac{d^2v(p_i)}{dt^2} < 0 \wedge v(p_i) < v(p_{i+1}) \right\}
\end{equation}

where $v(1) = min(v)$

The modality (MOD) is the prominence of each of these turning points (i.e the minimum drop required to the next turning point), weighted by the distance to the next turning point. This is normalised by the height of the month of maximum burnt area

\begin{equation}
    MOD =1 + \frac{ \Sigma_{i-1} \big( V(p_i) - min\left\{ v(p_i), v(p_{i+1}) \right\} \big) \times \big( 1 - cos(\theta) \big)}{2 \times \big(max(v) - v(1) \big)}
\end{equation}

If there are no turning points, then modality is set to 0. If there is one turning point, MOD is 1. The higher the number beyond that, the higher the modality. Observational and simulated MOD  was then compared using NME/NMSE.

For phase and concentration, each month, m, can be represented by a vector in the complex plane whose direction (m) corresponds to the time of year and length to the magnitude of the variable for that month:
\begin{equation}
    \theta_m = 2 \times \pi \times (m-1) / 12
\end{equation}

A mean vector L can be calculated by averaging the real ($L_x$) and imaginary ($L_y$) parts of the 12 vectors ($x_m$).

\begin{equation}
    L_x = \Sigma_m x_m \times cos(\theta_m) \ \text{   and   } \
    L_y = \Sigma_m x_m \times sin(\theta_m)
\end{equation}

Seasonal concentration (C) is the mean vector length by the annual average of the given variable, whilst seasonal phase (P) is the direction of the vector:

\begin{equation}
    C = \frac{\sqrt{L_x^2 + L_y^2}}{\Sigma_m x_m}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    P arctan{L_x/L_y}
\end{equation}

C is equal to 1 when a give variable is concentrated into one month, whilse P corresponds to that month. concentration is zero and phase is undefined if the variable  is evenly spread throughout the year, and the is not included in subsequent phase comparisons. Cis compared using NME/NMSE step 1. Phase is compared using mean phase difference (MPD), which represents the average timing erro, as a proportion of the maximum phase mismatch of 6 months.

\begin{equation}
    MPD = \pi^{-1} \times \Sigma_m A_i \times arccos \big[ cos \big(P_{sim, i} - P_{obs, i} \big) \big] / \Sigma_i A_i 
\end{equation}

\subsection{Metric interpretation}
Smaller NME, NMSE and MPD scores indicate a better agreement between simulation and observation, with a perfect score (i.e., simulation that perfectly matches observations) of 0. We also used three null models to help interpret the score as per (Burton et al., 2019; Kelley et al., 2019). The mean null model compares the mean of all observations with the observations. For NME and NMSE, the mean null model is always 1 as these metrics are normalised by the mean difference.. The best “single value” model for NME and MM compares the median of observations to observations. By definition, it’s score is less than or equal to the mean model score. The mean and median null model scores for MPD depends on the observations. The “randomly resampled” null model compares randomly-resampled observations (without replacement) to the observations. The score depends on resampling order, so we used 1000 bootstraps to determine the null models distribution. 


\subsection{Benchmark datasets}

\subsubsection{Climate}
Here we estimate the functional response of GPP to precipitation and surface downward shortwave radiation (SWR). For the global analysis, we use total grid points binned in terms of the independent variable (x) using 25 bins. In each bin, we compute the mean value of the corresponding dependent variable (y) to approximate the functional dependence of y on x. Data points show the mean and the error bars reﬂect the standard deviation range. We then assess the relationships by region using a simple scatter plot, first for South America tropical forest, and then South East Asia. Model data in all cases is the mean of the 9 ensemble members evaluated against observations from GBAF (GPP), CERES (SWR), and GPCP2 (precipitation) for 1982-2008 mean (see plots in section entitled “Climate Relationships”).

\subsubsection{Vegetation cover}
Three satellite land cover data sets were used for vegetation distribution comparisons. The European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative Land Cover data (CCI)\cite{hartley2017uncertainty} and that from the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme Land Use and Cover Change project (IGBP) \citep{Loveland2000-sx} and MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) \citep{Dimiceli_undated-el}.

\hilight{Andy - How was IBGP processed}
Three satellite land cover data sets were used for vegetation distribution comparisons. The European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative Land Cover data (CCI); \cite{hartley2017uncertainty,Poulter2015-lo} and that from the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme Land Use and Cover Change project (IGBP) (Loveland et al., 2000) and MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) (Dimiceli and Others, n.d.).

\subsubsection{LAI}


\subsubsection{Carbon (inc. Turnover)}
Observational soil carbon was estimated to a depth of 1m by combining the Harmonized World Soils Database (HWSD) [1] and Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database (NCSCD) [2] soil carbon datasets, where NCSCD was used where overlap occurs. For vegetation carbon, we used an observational land biomass dataset [3]. Observational GPP was derived from Fluxnet-MTE originally from monthly estimates of global biosphere-atmosphere fluxes from biogeochemistry group at Max Planck Institute [4]. The CARDAMOM (2001-2010) dataset is used for observational heterotrophic respiration [5]. The WFDEI dataset is used for our observational air temperatures (2001-2010) [6]. The GPCC dataset is used for our observational precipitation data [7].

\subsubsection{Wetland}
We process the UKESM Historical ensemble members from 2000 - 2014 and calculate the ensemble mean, regridded to 0.5 x 0.5 degrees.

The Wetland Area and Dynamics for Methane Modeling (WAD2M), an updated version of SWAMPS-GLWD (Poulter et al., 2017), is a 0.5 x 0.5 degree global wetland dynamic dataset that integrates the static Global Lakes and Wetlands Dataset (Lehner and Döll, 2004) with observations of the inundation seasonal cycle from the Surface WAter Microwave Product Series (Schroeder et al., 2015). WAD2M covers 2000 - 2018, overlapping with the UKESM historical up to 2014.

We compare the UKESM wetland fraction (fracWet) to the wetland fraction obtained from WAD2M. We calculate the zonal mean of both data sets between 2000 - 2014, as well as calculating the variability (standard deviation) in the temporal domain.

\subsubsection{River flow}
Modelled, long-term, annual river flow is compared against observations \citep{Dai2009}. For the direct comparison we use the \citep{Dai2009} dataset from 925 stations which only uses observations and does not infill using land surface model output. Only 1990-2005 mean annual river flow is assessed, because at the sub-annual time-scale some river flow measurements will be impacted by the presence of dams upstream, and dams are not yet parameterised in UKESM1. We only make comparisons with the observations where the time series overlap, which results in a comparison against 134 stations.

\subsection{Vegetation Distribution}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A lack on mix of tree and herb cover in much of the world, particularly Australia, Africa, Temperate America. The same could be true for Boreal regions, though there is disagreement in the observations here.
    \item Australia and SE Asia also show to tight a transition from non-vegetated to vegetated (R2 in Fig. \ref{fig:VegDistTri})
    \item causes too much tree cover extent and, in some places, to much bare ground with very rapid transitions (Figure  \ref{fig:VegDistMap}).
    \item grass extent is generally to small, but where grass does occur, there is too much of it.
    \item Too much bare soil in SE Asia, North Africa, possibly in Australia though depending on observations
    \item Too extensive in South Africa, North Africa, Boreal America, SE Asia,

\subsubsection{Carbon turnover}
\hilight{Rebecca V - summary of results}

\begin{itemize}

	\item Globally the spatial pattern of both ecosystem carbon turnover and soil carbon turnover is reasonably well matched in UKESM1-0-LL compared with observations, which can be seen in the Figures `ecosystem tau map' and `soil tau map' respectively; however there is a bias towards longer turnover times in UKESM1-0-LL compared with the observational data. There are regions in the northern mid-latitudes which have noticeably long turnover times in UKESM1-0-LL, which is not seen in the observational figure. This seems to be due to corresponding large quantities of soil carbon seen in these regions, which again is not seen in the observational figure.This could be due to cSoil being related to vegetation or due to nitrogen decomposition? However, we note that globally the soil carbon turnover times in UKESM1-0-LL better match the observational data compared with the ecosystem carbon turnover times. In regions of the Northern latitudes, UKESM1-0-LL produces very long ecosystem turnover times which are greater than the corresponding soil carbon turnover times. This is likely to be a result of not an accurate representation of high latitude vegetation.
	
	\item We investigated the spatial sensitivity of both ecosystem carbon turnover ($\tau_\mathrm{e}$), and soil carbon turnover ($\tau_\mathrm{s}$) to temperature and precipitation, which can be seen in Figures `ecosystem tau scatterplot' and `soil tau scatterplot' respectively. These sensitivities were considered on a global scale and for the different biomes considered in this study (Tropical Evergreen Forest, Temperate Forest, Grassland, Mediterranean, Desert, Boreal Forest, Tundra). In all cases, spatial data (latitude / longitude) was plotted as follows: precipitation (y-axis) against temperature (x-axis), and then the data was coloured by the respective turnover, $\tau_\mathrm{e}$ and $\tau_\mathrm{s}$, values (colour bar). Globally the spatial pattern of the sensitivity of $\tau_\mathrm{e}$ and $\tau_\mathrm{s}$ to temperature and precipitation is reproduced in UKESM1-0-LL compared with observations. We investigate these sensitivities in individual biomes to locate where UKESM1-0-LL accurately matched observations, and where there are differences and model improvements are required.
	
	\item In the Tropical Evergreen Forest biome, UKESM1-0-LL matches well with the observations, with only a marginally slower turnover in observations. In Figure `ecosystem tau scatterplot' it can be seen that there are points with unusually long ecosystem carbon turnover times, which is likely to be due to the vegetation allocation in this biome.
	
	\item In the Grassland and Temperate Forest biomes, for both $\tau_\mathrm{e}$ and $\tau_\mathrm{s}$, UKESM1-0-LL generally has longer turnover times compared with observations. This could potentially be due to vegetation disturbances, UKESM1-0-LL is known to have harsh vegetation transitions, which might be causing no vegetation to be growing in some regions. Additionally, for both $\tau_\mathrm{e}$ and $\tau_\mathrm{s}$, there seems to be more of a temperature relationship to turnover seen in this biome in UKESM1-0-LL compared with the observations, whereas in observations there is more of a sensitivity to precipitation.
	
	\item In the Mediterranean biome, UKESM1-0-LL does not match the temperature and precipitation relationships to $\tau_\mathrm{e}$ and $\tau_\mathrm{s}$ as seen in observations. In the observations, lower precipitation and higher temperature results in a longer carbon turnover, whereas the opposite affect is seen in UKESM1-0-LL.
	
	\item The Desert and Boreal Forest biomes are exceptions where UKESM1-0-LL does not produce slower carbon turnover compared with observations. In the Desert biome, a stronger temperature sensitivity on carbon turnover is seen in UKESM1-0-LL compared with observations, whereas a stronger precipitation sensitivity is seen in observations. This precipitation sensitivity is partly seen for $\tau_\mathrm{s}$, however is not seen at all for $\tau_\mathrm{e}$, which means it is likely to be due to wrong vegetation here? In the Boreal Forest biome, long carbon turnover times are seen in the observations, with a sensitivity to temperature within the biome, both of these are not seen in UKESM1-0-LL. Within UKESM1-0-LL, there is a slight precipitation sensitivity seen in this biome, though less variation in turnover is seen compared to observations.

	\item In the Tundra biome however, a greater variation of turnover is seen within the biome in UKESM1-0-LL compared with observations, due to a more apparent temperature sensitivity of turnover in UKESM1-0-LL. Again, this could be due to not an accurate representation of high latitude vegetation.
	
	\item \textit{We note our results are dependent on the choice of benchmark observational datasets (cite tau uncertainty paper).}

Red dotted line is observed annual burnt area from GFED4s}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{wetlands}
Generally good agreement is found between the two datasets, with large observed wetland fractions in the boreal regions reproduced in the model simulations. The tropical band of increased wetland fraction is found to be broader in the UKESM simulations than in the observations, particularly south of the Equator. We attribute much of this to a lack of tropical soils properties \citep{Gedney2019}.

Wetland methane emissions are primarily controlled by water table depth, temperature and available substrate. As such, adequately simulating the contemporary wetland area is important for modelling the methane cycle.  

\begin{figure*}[t]
    \includegraphics[width=16cm]{figs/Wetland.png}
    \caption{Zonal means in wetland extent for UKESM and observation.  \label{fig:wetland} }
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{River flow}
There is a strong correlation with the multi-annual river flow (figure ***) \hilight{add figure} and obtain a correlation coefficient between modelled and observed for the multi-annual mean and log of river flow are 0.96 and 0.84 respectively. If we compare this to a similar off-line run where JULES is forced with observations we obtain correlation coefficients of 0.97 and 0.85 respectively, indicating that on a multi-year time scale UKESM is reproducing river flow well overall across the globe.

\section{Pathway for future development}

\subsection{Fire}
\hilight{Chantelle/Doug}
Within JULES, the land surface component of UKESM1, the INteractive Fire and Emission algoRithm for Natural envirOnments (INFERNO) is used to calculate burned area and fire emissions \citep{Mangeon2016}. Fuel and soil moisture simulated by the DGVM, together with climate reanalysis, gives flammability, which is combined with prescribed ignitions from population and lightning to diagnose burned area and species emissions. Recent developments to the model include coupling between burned area and dynamic vegetation to represent vegetation mortality, which improves the distribution of vegetation in offline simulations using climate reanalysis \citep{Burton2019}. Other work is ongoing in coupling fire emissions from INFERNO to the atmosphere-only configuration of UKESM1, enabling emissions and aerosols to influence atmospheric chemistry, radiation, clouds and weather and feedback on fire, as well as implementing lightening ignitions from the model \citep{Joao2020}. These component developments within the land-surface and atmosphere will be brought together to form a major new development of fully coupled fire in the next version of UKESM. 

\subsection{Soils}
\hilight{Eleanor(/Karina? - any summary from that specialy report thing?}  I've currently added the permafrost bit in the section below.....

\subsection{Permafrost}
Permafrost (soil which is permanently frozen) presence has been evaluated in both HadGEM3 and UKESM1 \citep{Sellar2019-bo,burke2020evaluating}. \cite{burke2020evaluating} found that the simulated permafrost extent fell within the range of the observations for both models. However, they also found that the maximum summer thaw depth was too deep. This is partly because the soil is poorly resolved with only 4 soil layers in the top 3 m. Therefore one priority for the next configuration is to increase the number of soil layers. Recent developments in an offline version of JULES include a vertically resolved soil biogeochemsitry model \citep{wiltshire2020jules,burke2017vertical}. This enables the permafrost carbon feedback to be quantified \citep{burke2017quantifying} and will be included in a future version of UKESM.

\subsection{Inundation}
Inundation in UKESM is currently limited to that caused by groundwater. Incorporating inundation caused by rivers "over-banking" in JULES is currently underway  \citep{Dadson2010,Lewis2018} and is a priority for the next configuration. The large amount of evaporation from inundated open water is also important and should be included \citep{Dadson2010}. Adding tropical soils are shown to improve the spatial pattern of inundation in the tropics \citep{Gedney2019}.
