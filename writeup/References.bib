  abstract = "Drawing upon a variety of existing maps, data and information, a
              new Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD) has been created.
              The combination of best available sources for lakes and wetlands
              on a global scale (1:1 to 1:3 million resolution), and the
              application of Geographic Information System (GIS) functionality
              enabled the generation of a database which focuses in three
              coordinated levels on (1) large lakes and reservoirs, (2) smaller
              water bodies, and (3) wetlands. Level 1 comprises the shoreline
              polygons of the 3067 largest lakes (surface area $\geq$50 km2)
              and 654 largest reservoirs (storage capacity $\geq$0.5 km3)
              worldwide, and offers extensive attribute data. Level 2 contains
              the shoreline polygons of approx. 250,000 smaller lakes,
              reservoirs and rivers (surface area $\geq$0.1 km2), excluding all
              water bodies of level 1. Finally, level 3 represents lakes,
              reservoirs, rivers, and different wetland types in the form of a
              global raster map at 30-second resolution, including all water
              bodies of levels 1 and 2. In a validation against documented
              data, GLWD proved to represent a comprehensive database of global
              lakes $\geq$1 km2 and to provide a good representation of the
              maximum global wetland extent. GLWD-1 and GLWD-2 establish two
              global polygon maps to which existing lake registers,
              compilations or remote sensing data can be linked in order to
              allow for further analyses in a GIS environment. GLWD-3 may serve
              as an estimate of wetland extents for global hydrology and
              climatology models, or to identify large-scale wetland
              distributions and important wetland complexes.",

  abstract = "Anthropogenically driven declines in tropical savannah burnt
              area1,2 have recently received attention due to their effect on
              trends in global burnt area3,4. Large-scale trends in ecosystems
              where vegetation has adapted to infrequent fire, especially in
              cooler and wetter forested areas, are less well understood. Here,
              small changes in fire regimes can have a substantial impact on
              local biogeochemistry5. To investigate trends in fire across a
              wide range of ecosystems, we used Bayesian inference6 to quantify
              four primary controls on burnt area: fuel continuity, fuel
              moisture, ignitions and anthropogenic suppression. We found that
              fuel continuity and moisture are the dominant limiting factors of
              burnt area globally. Suppression is most important in cropland
              areas, whereas savannahs and boreal forests are most sensitive to
              ignitions. We quantify fire regime shifts in areas with more than
              one, and often counteracting, trends in these controls. Forests
              are of particular concern, where we show average shifts in
              controls of 2.3--2.6\% of their potential maximum per year,
              mainly driven by trends in fuel continuity and moisture. This
              study gives added importance to understanding long-term future
              changes in the controls on fire and the effect of fire trends on
              ecosystem function.",

               Nebraska-Lincoln and the European Commission's Joint Research
               Centre, Ispra, Italy produced a 1 km resolution global land
               cover characteristics database for use in a wide range of
               continental-to global-scale environmental studies. This database
               provides a unique view of the broad patterns of the
               biogeographical and ecoclimatic diversity of the global land
               surface, and presents a detailed interpretation of the extent of
               human development. The project was carried out as an
               International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme, Data and
               Information Systems (IGBP-DIS) initiative. The IGBP DISCover
               global land cover product is an integral component of the global
               land cover database. DISCover includes 17 general land cover
               classes defined to meet the needs of IGBP core science projects.
               A formal accuracy assessment of the DISCover data layer will be
               completed in 1998. The 1 km global land cover database was
               developed through a continent-by-continent unsupervised
               classification of 1 km monthly Advanced Very High Resolution
               Radiometer (AVHRR) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
               composites covering 1992-1993. Extensive post-classification
               stratification was necessary to resolve spectral/temporal
               confusion between disparate land cover types. The complete
               global database consists of 961 seasonal land cover regions that
               capture patterns of land cover, seasonality and relative primary
               productivity. The seasonal land cover regions were aggregated to
               produce seven separate land cover data sets used for global
               environmental modelling and assessment. The data sets include
               IGBP DISCover, U.S. Geological Survey Anderson System, Simple
               Biosphere Model, Simple Biosphere Model 2, Biosphere-Atmosphere
               Transfer Scheme, Olson Ecosystems and Running Global Remote

               mapping fractional surface water (FW) globally at 25-km
               resolution. The approach employs a land cover-supported,
               atmospherically-corrected dynamic mixture model applied to 20+
               years (1992--2013) of combined, daily, passive/active microwave
               remote sensing data. The resulting product, known as Surface
               WAter Microwave Product Series (SWAMPS), shows strong microwave
               sensitivity to sub-grid scale open water and inundated wetlands
               comprising open plant canopies. SWAMPS' FW compares favorably
               (R2 = 91\%--94\%) with higher-resolution, global-scale maps of
               open water from MODIS and SRTM-MOD44W. Correspondence of SWAMPS
               with open water and wetland products from satellite SAR in
               Alaska and the Amazon deteriorates when exposed wetlands or
               inundated forests captured by the SAR products were added to the
               open water fraction reflecting SWAMPS' inability to detect water
               underneath the soil surface or beneath closed forest canopies.
               Except for a brief period of drying during the first 4 years of
               observation, the inundation extent for the global domain
               excluding the coast was largely stable. Regionally, inundation
               in North America is advancing while inundation is on the retreat
               in Tropical Africa and North Eurasia. SWAMPS provides a
               consistent and long-term global record of daily FW dynamics,

  abstract  = "Increasing atmospheric methane (CH4) concentrations have
               contributed to approximately 20\% of anthropogenic climate
               change. Despite the importance of CH4 as a greenhouse gas, its
               atmospheric growth rate and dynamics over the past two decades,
               which include a stabilization period (1999--2006), followed by
               renewed growth starting in 2007, remain poorly understood. We
               provide an updated estimate of CH4 emissions from wetlands, the
               largest natural global CH4 source, for 2000--2012 using an
               ensemble of biogeochemical models constrained with remote
               sensing surface inundation and inventory-based wetland area
               data. Between 2000--2012, boreal wetland CH4 emissions increased
               by 1.2 Tg yr−1 (−0.2--3.5 Tg yr−1), tropical emissions decreased
               by 0.9 Tg yr−1 (−3.2−1.1 Tg yr−1), yet globally, emissions
               remained unchanged at 184 $\pm$ 22 Tg yr−1. Changing air
               temperature was responsible for increasing high-latitude
               emissions whereas declines in low-latitude wetland area
               decreased tropical emissions; both dynamics are consistent with
               features of predicted centennial-scale climate change impacts on
               wetland CH4 emissions. Despite uncertainties in wetland area
               mapping, our study shows that global wetland CH4 emissions have
               not contributed significantly to the period of renewed
               atmospheric CH4 growth, and is consistent with findings from
               studies that indicate some combination of increasing fossil fuel
               and agriculture-related CH4 emissions, and a decrease in the
               atmospheric oxidative sink.",

  abstract = "Abstract The increasing complexity of Earth system models has
              inspired efforts to quantitatively assess model fidelity through
              rigorous comparison with best available measurements and
              observational data products. Earth system models exhibit a high
              degree of spread in predictions of land biogeochemistry,
              biogeophysics, and hydrology, which are sensitive to forcing from
              other model components. Based on insights from prior land model
              evaluation studies and community workshops, the authors developed
              an open source model benchmarking software package that generates
              graphical diagnostics and scores model performance in support of
              the International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) project.
              Employing a suite of in situ, remote sensing, and reanalysis data
              sets, the ILAMB package performs comprehensive model assessment
              across a wide range of land variables and generates a
              hierarchical set of web pages containing statistical analyses and
              figures designed to provide the user insights into strengths and
              weaknesses of multiple models or model versions. Described here
              is the benchmarking philosophy and mathematical methodology
              embodied in the most recent implementation of the ILAMB package.
              Comparison methods unique to a few specific data sets are
              presented, and guidelines for configuring an ILAMB analysis and
              interpreting resulting model performance scores are discussed.
              ILAMB is being adopted by modeling teams and centers during model
              development and for model intercomparison projects, and community
              engagement is sought for extending evaluation metrics and adding
              new observational data sets to the benchmarking framework.",
